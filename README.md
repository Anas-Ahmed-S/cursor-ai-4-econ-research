## Templates

The `templates/` folder contains:

- **global-user-rules.md** — Default rules to paste into Cursor Settings for consistent behavior across projects
- **memory-bank/** — Template files for project documentation:
  - `project_brief.md` — Research question, approach, constraints
  - `data_dictionary.md` — Data files and variable definitions
  - `progress_log.md` — Running log of completed work

## Notes

This guide is based on my personal experience of using Cursor through November 2025. I have consolidated many of those learnings and reviewed them with the help of LLMs. Cursor may add new features or deprecate existing ones that are not reflected here.

I have since moved on to using Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, and similar tools directly from the command line interface. These offer more flexibility but require comfort with CLI environments, which not everyone has. This guide may or may not be actively updated going forward. For now, it serves as a starting point for researchers who want to learn AI-assisted coding in a more accessible environment before moving to advanced workflows. In the future, I may create a separate guide for using these CLI-based tools for economic research.

If you find this guide useful, have suggestions, or spot something that needs correcting, I would love to hear from you. Feel free to open an issue or reach out.
